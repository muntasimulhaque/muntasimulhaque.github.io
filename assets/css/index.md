    <h1>Muntasim Ul Haque</h1>
    <p>I’m a telecommunications professional with over 8 years of experience working on projects that keep people connected. Right now, I’m working in Bangladesh’s submarine cable systems, ensuring reliable, high-speed networks that reach millions. My work focuses on making sure our networks are resilient, efficient, and ready for the future.</p>
    <p>I started my journey with a bachelor degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from the <a href="https://www.iutoic-dhaka.edu/" target="_blank">Islamic University of Technology</a>, where I got hooked on the challenges of network and memory optimization. That passion has driven my work ever since!</p>
