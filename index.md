## About Me

Hello! I'm Muntasim Ul Haque, a passionate electrical and electronic engineer based in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Currently, I serve as a Deputy Manager at Bangladesh Submarine Cables PLC, where I'm involved in spearheading Bangladesh's 3rd submarine cable system implementation.

With a background in wireless communications and networking, I'm deeply interested in the intersection of technology and innovation. My research interests span wireless communications, mobile ad hoc networks, multimedia communication, sensors, and machine learning.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from the Islamic University of Technology (IUT). Throughout my career, I've worked on various projects, from ensuring smooth operations of submarine cable systems to developing contingency plans for cable downtimes.

My recent work includes publishing research on the challenges of implementing machine learning-driven IoT solutions in semiconductor design and wireless communication systems. I'm always eager to learn and contribute to advancements in my field.

When I'm not working, you might find me organizing tech events, participating in debates, or playing cricket and badminton. I believe in the power of technology to solve complex problems and am committed to driving innovation in the telecommunications sector.
