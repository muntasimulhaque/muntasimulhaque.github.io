## Some things about me:

## Some things I believe:
- As human beings it is our right (maybe our moral duty) to reshape the universe to our preferences.
    - Technology, which is really knowledge, enables this.
    - You should probably work on raising the ceiling, not the floor.
- Enthusiasm matters!
    - It's much easier to work on things that are exciting to you.
    - It might be easier to do big things than small things for this reason.
    - Energy is a necessary input for progress.
- It's important to do things fast.
    - You learn more per unit time because you make contact with reality more frequently.
