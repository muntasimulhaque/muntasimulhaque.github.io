# Nat Friedman

I'm an investor, entrepreneur, developer.

Some things about me:

* Grew up in Charlottesville, VA
* On the Internet since 1991, which is my actual "home town"
* Went to MIT because I loved the Richard Feynman [autobiographies](#)
* Started [two companies](#)
* CEO of [GitHub](#) from 2018 through 2021
* Live in California
* Working on reading the [Herculaneum Papyri](#)

Some things I believe:

* As human beings it is our right (maybe our moral duty) to reshape the universe to our preferences
    * Technology, which is really [knowledge](#), enables this
    * You should probably work on raising the ceiling, not the floor
* Enthusiasm matters!
    * It's much easier to work on things that are exciting to you
    * It might be easier to do big things than small things for this reason
    * Energy is a necessary input for progress
* It's important to do things fast
    * You learn more per unit time because you make contact with reality more frequently
    * Generally, when you focus on what's important there's no time for bullshit
    * "slow is fake"
* A week is not 1/52 of the year
    * Time is the denominator
* The criticism market hypothesis is a lie
    * At best it is a very lossy heuristic
    * The best things in life occur where EMH is wrong
    * In many cases it's more accurate to model the world as 500 people than 8 billion
    * Most people are other people
* We know less than we think
    * The replication crisis is not an aberration
    * Many of the things we believe are wrong
    * We are often not even asking the right questions
* The cultural prohibition on micromanagement is harmful
    * Great individuals should be fully empowered to exercise their judgment
    * The goal is not to avoid mistakes; the goal is to achieve unprecedented levels of excellence in some dimension
    * The downsides are worth it
* Smaller teams are better
    * Faster decisions, fewer meetings, more fun
    * No need to ship up work for political reasons
    * No room for mediocre people
    * Less ego and more output
* Large scale engineering projects are more soluble in 10 than they appear
    * Many tech companies are 2-10x overstaffed
* Where do you get your dopamine?
    * The answer is predictive of your behavior
    * Better to get your dopamine from improving your ideas than from having them validated
    * It's ok to get yours from "making things happen"
* You can do more than you think
    * We are tied down by invisible orthodoxy
    * The laws of physics are the only limit

Investing:

* The current areas of interest are AI, infrastructure, open source, and (some) frontier tech
* I lead seed and series A rounds, and often growth, investing between $1M and $100M
* I frequently [invest with Daniel Gross](#)
