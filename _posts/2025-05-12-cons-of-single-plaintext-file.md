title: "Why I Came Back to Using an Outliner App From the One Big Text File (OBTF)"

I was a happy outliner app user, particularly Dynalist, until I came across [this X post](https://muntasimulhaque.github.io/hello-world/){:target="_blank"} by Andrej Karpathy. In this post he talked about why append and ... is his preferred note taking system and why he loves it.

There are some people on X that I admire for their thinking process and Karpathy is one of them. I religiously read about whgatever he has to say, except for the things which I don;t understand and for those, I put them into pmy too tough list and move on. 

His post tells the story of his note taking process and why it works for him. It's apparently simple. And that can work for or against you depending on your how you work. Unfortutenly it didn't work for me. 

This is the gist of his note tking systm: he only has one note for all his note taking purposes. he uses Apple nbotes for this, which syncs tp a; his devices. He puts everything on it: todo, tobuy, ideas, codes and whatver comes to mind and anything and eveything. he uses this even as a passing copy-paste pad. 

The idea of is so simple, it's alluring to use it. You just open up your note takng app and jot down your notes. that's it. no cateogry, not tagging (except for very few like to watch, to read, etc.) and no formatting. Although he occasionally goes thorugh his notes and pulls up whatever he deems worthy of attention or has importance. 

So this is in short Karpathy's note taking system. He can read his full blog post here.

I was very surprised and interested in this super simple note taking method. THis is very similar to thge plain text note taking. THough I was familiar with plain text note taking and earlier tried it in different occasion, especially while using Linux termianl for everything. Back then I used to use the plain text note taking using vi text editor on a terminal for journaling.

But those days are long gone. My love for plain text still remains thugh. 

I love the idea of plain text note taking and would prefer it over propritary formats as plain text notes are sure to be supported in any device of the future. While proprietary formats may or may not be supported in the future.

Whle plain text note taking is great, the use of a single text file for all your notes may not be everyone's cup of tea. especiay for those who thrive on organizations and hierarchies.

Don't get me wrong. I love simplicity. I'm an advocate for simplicity. But I also believe that there's a limit to how much simpliciuty you shoul seek. 

Keeping everything on a single note is taking it a bit too far. you are left at the mercy of the default search or Ctrl+F. which works okay until you have repeitions of the word yoi're looking for. in that case, you migt want to introdude some tagging e.g. hashtags. 

Another issue that I faced is without hierarchies, categorization is nonexistent. you don't have any order. you don't know where something is. you are left at the mercy of the search. the higger the file gers, the slower the search would be. and the more time it might take for you to find what you are looking for.

as you are using a single file, it obviously gets bigger fast. the bigger the file, the more time it may take to load. also, you might risk losing data while syncing between devices. with a precautions and a good syncing solution though, this could be avoided. but still.

I've used a singlle note for all my note taking purposes, and it worked well for me. But as I looked ahead, I coul;dn't be optimistic for the future as the lack of orgazations would feel havy on me as I go ahead and my notes take on fat. I fear of not finding the exact thing when I need it and taking more time for a simple search.

Karpathy mantioned using multiple notes or usage of tags, etc. can put more cognitive load on the user compared to putting everyting on a single note that he uses. But from my experience of the past MONTHS, I can say I can take this little surge on cognititve load for the better organization of my notes and having a good grasp on them.

I switched back to my preferred note traking system: the outliners. I cam e back to using Dynalist. 

Iknow Dynliat is on maintenance mode and is almost dead. the developer put all its respurces on developing Obsidian and kept it barely alive with occasional bug fixing at best. But I'm okay with it. Even with the free version, Dynalist has everything I need. It gives me the flexibiity to organization my notes the way I want without getting in my way. It can be as simple or as complex depending on the user. I don't go overboard and so rather like to keep it simple.

I could use Workflowy whose development is now more active and now more feature-rich than Dynalist. But in my expeiecen, I found Dynalist noticeably faster than Workflowy. 

So Dynalist it is for mr for now.
