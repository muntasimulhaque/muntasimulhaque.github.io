I had my pretty simple note taking system until I came across [this X post](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1902503836067229803){:target="_blank"} by [Andrej Karpathy](https://x.com/karpathy){:target="_blank"}. Karpathy is one of those people on X, whose posts I read religiously for whatever they have to say. In this post Karpathy talked about why [append-and-review note](https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/the-append-and-review-note/){:target="_blank"} is his preferred note taking system and more importantly, why it works for him. 

The best thing about this note taking system is, it's ridiculously simple. Things that are this simple can both work for or against you, depending on how you work. 

Unfortutenly it didn't work for me.

Karpathy maintains only a single note for all his note taking purposes. He uses Apple Notes, which syncs to all his devices. He puts all kinds of notes in it: todo, to buy, ideas, code snippets and whatever else comes to his mind. He even uses it as a passing clipboard to copy and paste notes. 

This method of note taking is so simple, it only makes sense to use it. You just open your note takng app and jot down whatever is on your mind. That's it. No cateogry, no formatting and almost no tagging. Karpathy occasionally goes thorugh his notes and pull the note up to the top, whichever he deems worthy of his attention.

This note taking method's utter simplicity is what makes you try it for yourself. It's very similar to the plain text note taking. 

I used the plain text note taking on different occasions earlier, especially while I was using the termianl to do everything on Linux. Back then, I was taking plain text notes for journaling using the vi text editor.

Those days are long gone though. But my love and admiration for the plain text still remain. 

I love the idea of plain text note taking and prefer it over proprietary formats, because plain text notes are future-proof. They are most likely to be supported in the future on any device. But the same can't be said for the proprietary formats.

While plain text note taking is great, the use of a single plain text file for all your notes may not be so. Especially not for those who thrive on note organizations and structures.

Don't get me wrong. I love simplicity. That's my first priority. But I also know that trying to make a system too simple can make it rather complex. 

Keeping everything in a single note file is, in my opinion, taking simplicity a bit too far. 

Here you are left at the mercy of the default search. It works fine until you have too many repetitions of the word that you are looking for. Then you can't help but introduce some kind of tagging e.g. hashtags, to search for the specific word faster.

Another issue I found with the One Big Text File (OBTF) is, without some kind of structure or organizations, you don't have much order. You won't know where a certain note is. You are left at the mercy of the search alone. The drawback to that is, the bigger the file gets, the slower the search becomes and the more time it usually takes for you to find what you are looking for.

Also, you risk losing data while syncing between devices. With some precautions and a seamless syncing though, this can be avoided. But still.

Nonetheless, I've used the One Big Text FIle (OBTF) for all my note taking purposes for a month or so. And it worked well for me. But as I thought things through, things looked bleak. The lack of orgazation and structure would weigh heavy on me going forward as my notes gain weight. I'm afraid, finding a specific note would take an unnecessariliy long time, even for a seemingly simple search.

Karpathy said using multiple notes or usage of tags, specific structure, etc. put cognitive load on the user. I would rather take on this little surge of cognititve load at the expense of a better organization for my notes.

Finally I switched back to my preferred note taking system: using an outliner app. I came back to using Dynalist.

Dynalist is on maintenance mode now. The developers have shifted focus and put all their resources on Obsidian instead. They have kept Dynalist barely alive with occasional bug fixing at most. But I'm okay with it. Even with the free version, Dynalist has everything I need for my note taking purposes. It gives me the flexibiity to organize my notes the way I want without getting in the way. It can be as simple or as complex depending on however you want it to be. For my use case, I don't go overboard with it and rather keep it as simple as it suits my taste.

I could use Workflowy instead, whose development is now more active and is more feature-rich. From my experiences though, I found Dynalist noticeably faster than Workflowy. That's a dealbreaker for me. As long as it syncs across my devices and the developers don't pull the plug on Dynalist, I hope to keep using it.
