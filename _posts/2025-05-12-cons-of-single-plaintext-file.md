title: "Why I Came Back to Using an Outliner App From the One Big Text File (OBTF)"

I was a happy outliner app user, particularly [Dynalist](https://dynalist.io/){:target="_blank"}, until I came across [this X post](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1902503836067229803){:target="_blank"} by [Andrej Karpathy](https://x.com/karpathy){:target="_blank"}. In this post Karpathy talked about why [append-and-review note](https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/the-append-and-review-note/){:target="_blank"} is his preferred note taking system and most importantly, why it works for him. 

Karpathy is one of those people on X, whose all the posts I read curiosuly for whatever they have to say. In this post, he talked about his note taking process and why he chose it. It's selling point is, this note taking system is ridiculously simple. Things that are this simple can both work for or against you depending on your how you work. Unfortutenly it didn't work for me.

This is how this note taking method works: Karpathy only maintains a single note for all his note taking purposes. He uses Apple Notes for this, which syncs to all his devices. He puts all kinds of notes in it: todo, to buy, ideas, code snippets and whatever else comes to his mind. That means anything and eveything. He even uses this note even as a passing clipboard for copy and paste notes. 

This system of note taking is apparently so simple, it only makes sense to use it. You just open up your note takng app and jot down your whatever is on the mind. That's it. No cateogry, almost no tagging and no formatting. He occasionally goes thorugh his notes and pulls up to the top whichever note he deems worthy of attention or has apparent importance compared to others.

It's very hard not to try this method after hearing about it. This note taking method's utter simplicity is what makes you try it for yourself. It's very similar to the plaintext note taking. 

I used the plain text note taking on different occasions earlier, especially while I was using the termianl to do everything on Linux. Back then I was taking plaintext notes for journaling using the vi text editor on a terminal.

Those days are long gone though. But my love and admiration for the plain text still remains. 

I love the idea of plain text note taking and prefer it over proprietary formats as plain text notes are sure to be supported in the future on any device, whereas the same can't be said for sure for the proprietary formats.

While plain text note taking is great, the use of a single text file for all your notes may not be everyone's cup of tea. Especially to those who thrive on proper organizations and structures.

Don't get me wrong. I love simplicity. I'm an advocate for it. But I also know that trying to make a system too simple can make it rather complex. 

Keeping everything in a single note is, I think, taking simplicity a bit too far. Here you are left at the mercy of the default search or Ctrl+F. It works okay until you have too many repetitions of a word that you are looking for. Then you can't help but introduce some kind of tagging like hashtags.

Another issue I faced is that, without some kind of structure or organizations, you don't have any order. You don't know where a certain note is. You are left at the mercy of the search alone. The drawback of that is, the bigger the size of the file gets, the slower the search becomes and the more time it usually takes for you to find what you are looking for.

As you use a single file for your notes, it grows in size fast. The bigger the file, the more sluggish it becomes and thus the more time it takes to load. Also, you risk losing data while syncing between devices. With some precautions and a seamless syncing though, this can be avoided. But still.

Nonetheless, I've used a single plain text note or One Big Text FIle (OBTF) for all my note taking purposes, and it worked well for me. But as I looked ahead, I coul;dn't be optimistic for the future as the lack of orgazations would feel havy on me as I go ahead and my notes take on fat. I fear of not finding the exact thing when I need it and taking more time for a simple search.

Karpathy mantioned using multiple notes or usage of tags, etc. can put more cognitive load on the user compared to putting everyting on a single note that he uses. But from my experience of the past MONTHS, I can say I can take this little surge on cognititve load for the better organization of my notes and having a good grasp on them.

I switched back to my preferred note traking system: the outliners. I cam e back to using Dynalist. 

Iknow Dynliat is on maintenance mode and is almost dead. the developer put all its respurces on developing Obsidian and kept it barely alive with occasional bug fixing at best. But I'm okay with it. Even with the free version, Dynalist has everything I need. It gives me the flexibiity to organization my notes the way I want without getting in my way. It can be as simple or as complex depending on the user. I don't go overboard and so rather like to keep it simple.

I could use Workflowy whose development is now more active and now more feature-rich than Dynalist. But in my expeiecen, I found Dynalist noticeably faster than Workflowy. 

So Dynalist it is for mr for now.
