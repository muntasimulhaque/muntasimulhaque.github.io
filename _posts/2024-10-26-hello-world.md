Hello World!

This is my first blog post here, on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"} using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} under the hood. I've blogged on different platforms before e.g. Blogspot, Wordpress, Tumblr, Medium, etc. So, what's different this time? 

Well, this time I'm posting on a static site. 

## What's the advantage of using a static site?

Nothing. I mean, I didn't choose to blog here just because it gave me a leverage over other platforms. It's just that, using Jekyll makes the experience a bit simpler to blog on GitHub Pages.

## Why blog on GitHub Pages?

I didn't specifically choose to blog here. I intended this site to serve as my academic portfolio. 

To develop this site, I tried other GitHub Pages sites and forked the ones I liked. Among them, [Academic Pages](https://academicpages.github.io/){:target="_blank"} stood out to me. It's actually a good starting point for someone who needs to create an academic site without much knowledge of behind the scenes. In fact, I forked Academic Pages earlier. But as I delved deeper, I realized it's overkill for my use case. 

I wanted a simple site that looks and acts as I wanted. Academic Pages is great in that respect, but for me, I had to change a lot of its codes to make it my own. 

So, at one point, I abandoned it and started from scratch. And this is the end-product that you're seeing. But of course, I believe improvement is a never-ending game. So this site will likely change in the future.

Coming back to the point, blogging here wasn't something I set out to do at the outset. While searching for the perfect site, I saw some people blogging using Jekyll on GitHub Pages. So I thought why not try it? 

I am a believer of sharing knowledge with others. I've shared my knowledge with others before, I am sharing now and I will continue to share in the days to come.

## What's next?

This site will act mainly as my academic portfolio. I don't have any master-plan of doing anything big here. 

Talking about blogging, I'll occasionally share my knowledge, ideas and thoughts. I don't have any plan of implementing social share button, or commenting. But I can't talk about the future. The future will decide for itself.

Enough talk for now, go and have a great life!
