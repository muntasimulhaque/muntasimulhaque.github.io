## Software

### Windows

#### Image Viewer

**[nomacs](https://nomacs.org/){:target="_blank"}**  

  - Lightweight. Responsive. Fast.
  - The dealbreaker feature for me is to double click for full screen and again to toggle. Also, mouse wheel scrolling to zoom.
  
#### Text Editor

**[Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/){:target="_blank"}**  

  - More features and customization options than Windows' default notepad.
  - Still fast and lightweight.
